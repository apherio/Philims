# Philims - Popular Movies App

Its part of the Android Developer Nanodegree Program.In this project, I  have  build an app to help users discover popular and recent movies.Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. In this project, we have  build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing. We  split the development of this app in two stages. 


## STAGES 

PHASE 1 :
* Discover the most popular, the most rated or the highest rated movies
* Added animated recycler view with autofit grids


PHASE 2 : 
* WORK IN PROGRESS


## Import Instructions

This app uses [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) API to retrieve movies.
You must provide your own API key in order to build the app. When you get it, just paste it to:
    ```
    app/build.gradle
    ```
